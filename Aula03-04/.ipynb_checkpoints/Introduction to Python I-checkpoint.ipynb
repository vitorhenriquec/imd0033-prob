    "Data science involves processing, analyzing, and visualizing data. While some tools like Microsoft Excel allow us to perform basic data science tasks, they're limited to the functionality built in to the user interface. If you want to work with datasets that aren't structured like a spreadsheet or create entire new data visualizations from scratch, you'll need to become proficient in **programming**. Instead of using a program written by others that can solve a narrow set of tasks, you can create your own programs that can solve your specific problems.\n",

    "Programming involves organizing a collection of instructions into a program for a computer to carry out. To express these instructions, we use a **programming language**. In this track, we focus on a language called Python. **Python** is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing **data science**. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and get a competitive edge.\n",

When we import a module this way, we add all of the objects and functions within that module to the global **namespace**. A namespace is a dictionary that contains all of the names we can refer to in our code. Before running our code, the Python interpreter adds all of the objects and functions that are available by default (<span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">print()</span>,  <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">list()</span>, etc.) to the global namespace. When we create variables or define our own functions, these are also added to the same namespace.\n",
