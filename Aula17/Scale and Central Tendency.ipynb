    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, statistics is about counting and measuring. In order to do both effectively, we have to define scales on which to base our counts. A scale represents the possible values that a variable can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equal Interval Scales**\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal interval scales are always consistent. Think of the speed of a car. No matter what speed you're traveling at, a difference of five miles per hour is always five miles per hour. The difference between 60 and 55 miles per hour will always be equal to the difference between 10 and five miles per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logarithmic Scales**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step on a logarithmic scale represents a different order of magnitude. The Richter scale that measures the strength of earthquakes, for example, is a logarithmic scale. The difference between a 5 and a 6 on the Richter scale is more than the difference between a 4 and 5. This is because each number on the Richter scale represents 10 times the shaking amplitude of the previous number. A 6 on the Richter scale is 10 times more powerful (technically, powerful is the wrong term, but it makes thinking about this easier) than a 5, which is 10 times more powerful than a 4. A 6 is 100 times more powerful than a 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look out!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the mean of the values on an equal interval scale by adding those values, and then dividing by the total number of values. We could do the same for the values on a non-equal interval scale, but the results wouldn't be meaningful, due to the differences between units.\n",

    "==\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, kurtosis (from Greek: κυρτός, kyrtos or kurtos, meaning \"curved, arching\") is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. In a similar way to the concept of skewness, kurtosis is a descriptor of the shape of a probability distribution and, just as for skewness, there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Depending on the particular measure of kurtosis that is used, there are various interpretations of kurtosis, and of how particular measures should be interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kurtosis of any univariate normal distribution is 3. It is common to compare the kurtosis of a distribution to this value. Distributions with kurtosis less than 3 are said to be platykurtic, although this does not imply the distribution is \"flat-topped\" as sometimes reported. Rather, it means the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than does the normal distribution. An example of a platykurtic distribution is the uniform distribution, which does not produce outliers. Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be leptokurtic. An example of a leptokurtic distribution is the Laplace distribution, which has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a Gaussian, and therefore produces more outliers than the normal distribution. It is also common practice to use an adjusted version of Pearson's kurtosis, the excess kurtosis, which is the kurtosis minus 3, to provide the comparison to the normal distribution. Some authors use \"kurtosis\" by itself to refer to the excess kurtosis. \n"
